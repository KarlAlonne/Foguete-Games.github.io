<h1 align="center">What are Indie Games?</h1>
Independent video game development is the process of creating independent video games without the financial backing or a video game publisher. Large companies can also create independent games, but they are usually produced by a small team of people, depending on the complexity of the project. Such projects can take anywhere from days to years to complete, depending on the complexity of people and participants.
